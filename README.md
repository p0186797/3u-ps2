Create a file called **teams.py** and upload it to this repo. 

A sporting organization separates teams into different leagues based on how many games they have won in an 8 game season.
If they have won 1 – 2 games inclusive they are in the “Beginner” league. If they have won 3 – 4 games inclusive they are in the “Intermediate” league. If they have won 5 – 6 games inclusive they are in the “Advanced” league. And if they have won 7 games or more they are in the championship league. If they did not win a single game – they cannot compete. Write a program that takes in 8 lines of input – either W or L and outputs what league they are in: Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, Championship, Cannot Compete.
